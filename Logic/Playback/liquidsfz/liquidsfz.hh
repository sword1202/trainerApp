\mainpage LiquidSFZ

\section intro_sec Introduction

LiquidSFZ is a library to load and replay sample based instruments in .sfz format. If you want
to use libquidsfz in your own project, use the LiquidSFZ::Synth class.

\section simple_example A Simple Example

\code
// Compile this example with:
// $ g++ -o example example.cc `pkg-config --libs --cflags liquidsfz`

#include <liquidsfz.hh>

int
main (int argc, char **argv)
{
  if (argc != 2)
    {
      printf ("usage: %s <sfz_filename>\n", argv[0]);
      return 1;
    }

  LiquidSFZ::Synth synth;
  synth.set_sample_rate (48000);

  if (!synth.load (argv[1])) // load sfz
    {
      printf ("%s: failed to load sfz file '%s'\n", argv[0], argv[1]);
      return 1;
    }

  // start a note
  synth.add_event_note_on (0, 0, 60, 100);

  // render one block of audio data
  float left_output[1024];
  float right_output[1024];
  float *output[2] = { left_output, right_output };
  synth.process (output, 1024);

  // at this point we would typically play back the audio data
  for (int i = 0; i < 1024; i++)
    printf ("%d %f %f\n", i, left_output[i], right_output[i]);
}
\endcode

# Using multiple threads

The LiquidSFZ API, unless otherwise documented, doesn't use locks to make the
API thread safe. This means that you are responsible that <b>only one API
function is executed at a time</b>.

So you must not call a function (i.e. \ref Synth::process) in thread A and
another function (i.e. \ref Synth::load) in thread B so that both are running
at the same time. Instead you need to either use a mutex to ensure that only
one function is running at a time, or use other synchronization between the
threads A and B to ensure that only one thread uses the \ref Synth instance at
any point in time.

Note that if you have more than one \ref Synth instance (object), these can be
treated as isolated instances, i.e. different instances can be use concurrently
from different threads.

## The audio thread

Most applications will have one single real-time thread that generates the
audio output. In this real-time thread, only some of the API functions provided
by liquidsfz should be used, to avoid stalling the audio thread (for instance
by waiting for a lock, allocating memory or doing file I/O).

- \ref Synth::active_voice_count
- \ref Synth::add_event_note_on
- \ref Synth::add_event_note_off
- \ref Synth::add_event_cc
- \ref Synth::add_event_pitch_bend
- \ref Synth::all_sound_off
- \ref Synth::process
- \ref Synth::set_gain
- \ref Synth::system_reset

Typically these restrictions mean that at the beginning of your application,
you setup the \ref Synth object by loading an .sfz file, setting the sample
rate, number of voices and so forth. Eventually this is done, and you start a
real time thread that does audio I/O. Since you must ensure that only one
thread at a time is using the \ref Synth object, you would then only use
the functions of this list in the audio thread and no longer use any other
function from any other thread.

If you need to access one of the other functions (for instance for loading a
new .sfz file using \ref Synth::load), you would ensure that the audio thread
is no longer using the \ref Synth object. Then the setup phase would start
again, loading, setting sample rate and so forth, until you can restart the
audio thread.

## Callbacks from load

It is possible to request progress information for \ref Synth::load by using
\ref Synth::set_progress_function. If you enable this, the progress function
will be invoked in the same thread that you called \ref Synth::load.

## Callbacks from the logging framework

If you setup a custom log function using \ref Synth::set_log_function,
callbacks will occur in the threads that you call functions in. For example,
if you \ref Synth::load during initialization, you will get callbacks in the
thread you started load in.

Messages that are <b>relevant to end users</b> are errors, warnings and info
messages.  For these log levels, we guarantee that such log messages are never
produced from functions that can be run in the audio thread (real time thread).
These log messages are enabled by default.

This means that the callback set by \ref Synth::set_log_function doesn't need
to be realtime safe, as these callbacks only occur in non-rt-safe functions
such as \ref Synth::load.

Messages that are <b>relevant to developers</b> use the log level debug. These
can occur from any thread, including real time safe functions like \ref
Synth::process. Debug messages are only relevant for developers, so in almost
every case you should keep them disabled, which is the default. If you enable
debug messages using \ref Synth::set_log_level, you either need to provide an
realtime safe logging callback or accept that during development, debug
messages will break realtime capabilty.
